# dots-swayfx
- I wanted to try something new but still want a wayland compositor made for humans that's similar to Hyprland, so swayfx.
- I don't plan to ditch that water drop compositor though.
- Note that this might no be frequently updated. see my [Hyprland dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) for a more regularly updated shell
